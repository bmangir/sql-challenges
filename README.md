# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project and challenges are designed to find the SQL solutions to problems. Each challenge contains a description of the problem, the expected output, and the SQL code to solve it.

- Inside each folder, there is a README.md file that contains:
  - A brief description of the challenge.
  - The SQL code used to solve the challenge.
  - Any additional notes or explanations about the solution.
