-- QUESTION 1: CUSTOMER FINANCIAL ACTIVITY ANALYSIS
-- Calculate the customer-based financial behavior score for the last 60 days.
-- Retrieve the last 60 days of transactions for each customer.
-- Calculate the following metrics:
--      Total number of transactions
--      Total transaction amount (without distinction between positive and negative)
--      Average transaction amount
--      Monthly trend â†’ Difference between total amount of the last 2 months (e.g., October and September)
-- Calculate the Behavior_Score using these metrics:
--      Behavior_Score = (total_amount / average_amount) + (trend_difference / 100)
-- Segment the customer based on the Behavior_Score using RANK() and NTILE(3).
-- (1: High Value, 2: Medium Value, 3: Low Value)
